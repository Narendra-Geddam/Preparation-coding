Level 1 — Core fundamentals (interview-critical foundation)

Variables

Input handling

Arithmetic

if conditions

Level 2 — Classic interview problems (logic building)

Factorial

Fibonacci

Prime number

Palindrome

Reverse number

Level 3 — Intermediate scripting (interview + DevOps bridge)

Loops

Functions

Argument handling

File reading

Level 4 — DevOps production scripting

Log monitoring

Deployment automation

Process monitoring

Self-healing scripts

This builds both:

Interview problem-solving ability

Real DevOps automation ability

We will start with the most important foundational interview concept:

Concept — Arithmetic operations in shell script

What it is:
Shell script can perform arithmetic using special syntax. This allows scripts to calculate values like factorial, Fibonacci, counters, etc.

Why it exists:
Automation often requires numeric logic:

Counting retries

Incrementing version numbers

Loop counters

Resource calculations

Where used in production:

Retry mechanisms

Log rotation counters

Backup versioning

Monitoring thresholds

Syntax (critical):
